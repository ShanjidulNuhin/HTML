        Turn you to a dancer
        Yeah (Internet Money, bitch)

        I got black, I got white, what you want?
        Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
        I know I'm 'bout to blow, I ain't dumb
        They try to take my flow, I take they - for ransom
        I know that I'm gone
        They see me blowin' up, now they say they want some
        I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer
        I see two twin opps, leave 'em on a banner
        And I got two thick thots, wanna link the gang, yeah

        I got red, I got blue, what you want?
        The Chanel or Balenciaga, Louis and Vuitton
        She know I got the Fendi, Prada when I hit Milan
        I needed me a die or rider, I need me the one

        I started from the bottom, you could see the way I stunt
        I want all the diamonds, I want that - to weigh a ton
        The opps, they tryna line me 'cause they hate the place I'm from
        But them - don't know me, they just know the place I'm from

        I got lots of shawties tryna pull up to my place
        But you ain't want me last year, so just get up out my face
        They all up in my inbox, so I know they want a taste
        I know they want my downfall, lil' -, are you laced?

        I got black, I got white, what you want?
        Hop outside a Ghost and hop up in a Phantom
        I know I'm 'bout to blow, I ain't dumb
        They try to take my flow, I take they - for ransom
        I know that I'm gone
        They see me blowin' up, now they say they want some
        I got two twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer
        I see two twin opps, leave 'em on a banner
        And I got two thick thots, wanna link the gang, yeah
        
        I got black, I got white, what you want?

        They try to take my flow, I take they - for ransom
